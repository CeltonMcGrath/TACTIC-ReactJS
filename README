# How to create an application with a ReactJS front-end and TACTIC back-end

You need a TACTIC Plugin that contains a project setting 

reactjs/build_dir 

and you need to place the build directory of your React App at this location.
The location should be accessible by apache (ie. /plugins, or directly in your plugin folder.)

ie.

key = reactjs/build_dir
value = "/plugins/my_app_plugin/build"
